# GEOFFREY_MORINGA_IP_W9

# Two Python Projects:
1. Predicting Survival in the Titanic Disaster.
2. Predicting whether an email is spam or ham.

# Description
In the first project, I predict whether a passenger on the titanic would have survived or not.

In the second project, I predict whether an email is spam or not.

# Experimental Design
## Project 1: Predicting survival in the titanic Disaster
* Loading & Viewing the Data
* Data Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Feature Engineering
* Modelling: K-Nearest Neighbor
* Conclusion

## Project 2: Predicting whether an email is a spam or ham
* Loading & Viewing the Data
* Data Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Feature Engineering
* Modelling:
  * Multinomial Naive Bayes
  * Gaussian Naive Bayes
* Challenging the solution
* Conclusion
